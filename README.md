## Description

This program allows the user to graphically create byte arrays for use with the Arduino Mega 2560 controller in combination with the MAX72XX device.</br>
To use the app outside NetBeans, copy the folders “lib, images” together with the jar file from the target directory in the NetBeans project into a folder of your choice.</br>
As this is a Swing project, the app can then be started simply by double-clicking on the jar file.</br>
An Ino test file is included in the project folder.
